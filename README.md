# copycat-website-project

    The purpose of the project is to practice using CSS and HTML by choosing a website that I want to code without interactive or animation.  I have decided to make PupilPath Login because I think their background color is really special and attractive since it mixing with two different colors. This may be a complicated part of my project so I will be asking for help from classmates and researching the code on my own. The other conflict I might face is whenever I touch the text, the text will be underlined or when touching sign in it will glow up. To start creating the website I will have to list out all the HTML and CSS language that  needed for making the Pupilpath Login. It is also an opportunity for me to learn many skills such as time management, overcome obstacles and growth mindset.
